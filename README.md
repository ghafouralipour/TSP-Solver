# TSP-Solver
This is a simple TSP solver in React js that uses d3.js for visualization. Click a bunch of spots on the map to make "points", then click "Run" to run the TSP solver. It will display the final solution and total distance in bird's eye  view. (Note, it minimizes flat x/y Euclidean distances, Turkey map is there for effect.)
